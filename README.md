# Pig-Game

## Instructions:

A multiplayer dice game that includes rolling the dice and holding as many rolls as you can before rolling either a "1" or reaching the winning number of 100!

Remember, deciding to hold your number or rolling the devastating "1" will result in a player swap, so hold as many rolls as possible before your opponent reaches the target of 100 or before you roll a one.

### Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor...
